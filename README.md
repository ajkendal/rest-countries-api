## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode _(optional)_

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Utility-first CSS framework
- [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/) - Country data API
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) - Design and prototyping tool

### What I learned

Throughout this project, I learned and applied several key concepts:

- **Next.js App Directory:** Leveraged the new app directory for server/client separation, routing, and layout management.
- **Fallback Data Strategy:** Implemented a failsafe mechanism to use local `data.json` if the REST Countries API is unavailable, ensuring reliability.
- **Theme Switching:** Integrated `next-themes` and Tailwind CSS to provide seamless light/dark mode toggling with hydration guard to prevent SSR/client mismatches.
- **Responsive Design:** Used Tailwind CSS and Flexbox/Grid to create a mobile-first, fully responsive UI that adapts to all device sizes.
- **Dynamic Filtering & Sorting:** Built custom dropdowns and search/filter logic for countries and regions, including combining 'All Regions' and specific regions.
- **Border Country Lookup:** Translated border country codes to names and enabled navigation between countries.
- **Hydration Error Prevention:** Applied hydration guards and conditional rendering to eliminate hydration errors from theme toggling and dynamic content.
- **Reusable Components:** Developed modular components (Header, CountryCard, ErrorCard, LoadingIconDiv) for maintainable and scalable code.

Example: Hydration Guard for Theme Toggle

```js
const [mounted, setMounted] = useState(false)
useEffect(() => {
  setMounted(true)
}, [])
if (!mounted) return null // Prevents hydration errors
```

This project reinforced best practices in React/Next.js development, error handling, and modern CSS workflows.

### Failsafe Data

If the REST Countries API is unavailable, this project will automatically use a local `data.json` file located in `public/json/data.json` as a fallback to ensure the app remains functional.
